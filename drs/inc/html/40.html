<p>Built a fully-functional end-to-end workflow with Palantir Foundry
  components. This was a simple operational tool for a demo 
  fulfillment department that connected to two IT systems. It 
  created a single location for managers to assign orders, show 
  what orders hadn't been assigned, and what was at risk of not 
  being delivered.</p>
