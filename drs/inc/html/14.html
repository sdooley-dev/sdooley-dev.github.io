
    <h1>Salesforce Administrator â€” Course &amp; Certification Summary (Completed)</h1>
    <p>
      I successfully completed the Salesforce Administrator curriculum and earned the Salesforce Administrator certification.
      Throughout the program, I configured and managed a Salesforce org end-to-end, focusing on security, data modeling,
      automation, analytics, and user experience in Lightning. I practiced real-world admin tasks in a sandbox, implemented
      governance and change controls, and delivered reports and dashboards to business stakeholders.
