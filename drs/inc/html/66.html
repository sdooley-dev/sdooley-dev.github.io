<p>I built this built using Cursor Ai with modern web technologies 
    including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6 modules, and 
    responsive design principles. Features dynamic content loading, 
    interactive lightbox galleries, and machine-readable data 
    processing. Powered by Font Awesome icons, *XLSX data

    <p>*Initially, I architected the data layer using PostgreSQL for robust relational database management and hosted it on a traditional backend infrastructure. However, to align with GitHub Pages' static hosting constraints and eliminate backend dependencies, I migrated the data architecture to a tabular format using Excel spreadsheets. This approach leverages XLSX parsing libraries in JavaScript to dynamically load and process structured data client-side, maintaining data integrity while enabling seamless deployment on GitHub's static hosting platform.</p>
