On the evening of January 15th, we needed very quick testing assistance for the Tele-EC application. Most of the Tele-EC testers were unavailable for after-hours testing and the CRM team was asked to assist. Thank you, Steve, for volunteering to help test the hotfix for an application you are not overly familiar with! Because of your assistance, we were able to complete testing in 2 environments to prep for the final round of testing next day. This fix would not have been possible on the timeline asked without your extensive after-hours assistance.
