<h3 id="card-title-top">Copado Certified Fundamentals 1</h3>
<p>I completed the Copado Certified Fundamentals 1 course and gained a solid foundation in Salesforce DevOps with Copado, including how Copado connects to a Git repository and manages changes through user stories.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Core Concepts:</b> Understood what Copado is, how it supports DevOps on Salesforce, and how user stories act as containers for development work.</li>
  <li><b>Commit Changes:</b> Practiced committing metadata to user stories and preparing changes for delivery.</li>
  <li><b>Promote &amp; Deploy:</b> Learned to promote and deploy user stories across environments using the release pipeline.</li>
  <li><b>Branching Strategy:</b> Reviewed branch flows and how Copadoâ€™s strategy organizes collaborative work.</li>
  <li><b>Back Promotion:</b> Applied techniques to sync lower environments with fixes and updates from higher environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end, I could move changes reliably through the pipeline, collaborate using Git, and keep environments aligned with promotions and back promotions.</p>
