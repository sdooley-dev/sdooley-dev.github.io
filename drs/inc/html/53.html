<b>Colleague - Booz Allen</b>
<p class="vspace-paragraph"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left quote-begin"></i>I had the privilege of working with Steve Dooley for several months at Booz Allen. As with any project acclimations, there was quite a bit to learn and Steve lent himself as an incredible resource and mentor during our time working together. To say he knew our product is an understatement- Steve was the go to resource for anything product related, and I attribute my success on this team because of all of the knowledge that he provided me.</p>

<p class="vspace-paragraph">I really appreciate how dedicated Steve was to our team. There is a difference between folks who just clock in for a 9-5 verses folks like this gentleman who truly wanted to see the success of our work come to fruition and would do anything in his power to see this through.</p>

<p class="vspace-paragraph">Having spent a great amount of time with Steve, I am continuously impressed by his dedication and curiosity for learning new technical skills. He's worked to become a jack of all trades in various Salesforce capabilities such as Omnistudio, Experience Cloud, and declarative capabilities, as well as JS, CSS, HTML, XML, and JSON, to name a few. Steve has also shared his interest and work with AWS, having obtained the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and tapping into AWS GenAI workshops. I am excited to see his AWS journey continue as he continues on his career journey.</p>

<p class="vspace-paragraph">It's been a pleasure working with Steve and I am certain he will go above and beyond in any role he is aligned to.</p>

has helped the project identify and troubleshoot many bugs, saving the team countless hours of work. On top of being thorough and

ability to bridge the gap between development and QA proved to be key to the success of the VAHC project.
</p>
<p class="vspace-paragraph">Steve was also a collaborative and dependable teammate. Even though I was the most junior member of the team, Steve welcomed my ideas and
assisted me whenever asked. He quickly became a go-to source for our team, always lending a hand and going out of his way to help people
with questions they had. It was a pleasure working with him, and I'm sure he would benefit any project.

    <p class="vspace-paragraph"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left quote-begin"></i>Steve joined the Veterans Tracking Application (VTA) project to provide support in transitioning DoD and VA from a .NET application to a Salesforce VTA 2.0 solution to stream and modernize the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES). IDES is a joint Department of Defense (DoD) and VA disability evaluation process. VTA 2.0 will support both the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) branches. IDES seeks to ensure seamless service delivery by eliminating the duplicate, time consuming, and often confusing and overlapping elements of the two current disability processes. The IDES seeks to ensure the program provides Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and Coast Guardsmen optimal service and satisfaction for them and their family in receiving quality, fair, and just care and benefits. Wounded, injured and/or ill Service Members (SMs) are entered into IDES based on their Service to see if they meet retention standards. VTA 2.0 tracks these SMs from entrance into IDES through Return to Duty or Separation (with/without benefits). The program executes 25K cases annually with routine communications between DoD and VA. Steve will be focused on the build of detailed reports, formulas, and providing training to the VA Reports Team which impacts 1,800 VTA Stakeholders (DoD and VA). We discussed documenting goals in Workday related to the project to track and document progress. Steve has been a vibrant burst of energy to the VTA Team and has stepped up to take on a high visibility task for the project success. Steve is eager and determined as a team player and has made an instant impact to customer solutions. Thanks Steve.</p>

    <b>Training Coordinator - Booz Allen</b>
    <p class="vspace-paragraph"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left quote-begin"></i>I was extremely impressed with Steve's level of growth during SFA, given the level of complexity the Developer path delves into. It is always a gift when someone from the consulting side of our projects learns the more technical aspect of our work,  in this case, Salesforce, and Steve embraced learning the technical aspects of Salesforce right away.  He always came to class prepared, ready to participate, practice, and ask great questions. Comparing Steve's  baseline level of performance (pre-test for Platform Developer I) and his final performance, there was a 45% increase in  growth, according to the pre and post-test scores. This was the greatest growth gain in the entire class.  Steve also finished in the top 3 of the Developer class, and there were folks in there that had backgrounds in coding.  This is all to say that Steve held his own and then some working and performing next to other Developers,  so I know that if this is his ultimate desire for his career path, I have no doubt he'll be successful.</p>    
    
    <p>Strengths: Steve is unafraid to dive into skills and concepts that most would be frightened of (coding languages and concepts). He approaches work as an opportunity to learn, improve, and continually grow his skillset.  I would say his strengths are in the Passionate Service and Collective Ingenuity values.  He is great at making meaningful connections with the work we do and the ever-changing technology landscape,  as well as his resourcefulness and finding ways to have the biggest positive impact on the project he's working on.</p>
    
    <p>Steve has a bright future ahead of him here and he's embracing the skills he sees are valued at the firm, going after the training to achieve that skillset.

He originally came on to help us push to  go-live and due to the value he provided the project, he ended up staying well past go live to continue providing  post go live support. Steve did an amazing job working through complex reporting and formula work that  the customer was requesting. This work often did not have robust requirements and the client frequently  changed their minds/switched up the business purpose for the reports. Steve was diligent and took charge to  get this work organized, documented, and completed to the business need the client had. If he needed additional  context, he did not hesitate to reach out to the team or the client with questions. He did an amazing job of  working with an often difficult client, balancing what they wanted with what we could contractually deliver.  Steve also did a great job of ensuring his work was up to date in Jira with comments/notes to add useful context.

He kept our team organized and on the same page, establishing repositories for our documents, creating graphics and templates, and building presentations. While doing all of these managerial tasks, he still took on more than his share of the project when we had a team reconfiguration.
