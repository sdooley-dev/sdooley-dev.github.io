    Just before the DTC blackout period for production deployments, an issue was found in production which required a fast follow release to correct the problem for our client. The QA team needed to work over the weekend to get testing completed on time and the Regression Heroes team was asked to own the testing of the feature. The Regression Heroes team stayed late Friday to complete testing and made themselves available for additional weekend testing if it was needed. The Regression Heroes team is best in class and exemplifies teamwork. Thank you for your dedication to our Veterans!
