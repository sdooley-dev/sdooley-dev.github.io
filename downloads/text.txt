Hi Janelle xxx - I uploaded many of the associated files built for the automation of 602 [link].

From a reporting perspective, I'm not sure any of these will be useful.  However, I can see potential for the 
[total test ryn analytics xxx] report, where I calculate the total time it takes for each step to run per second.

I could see that being useful to demonstrate efficiencies gained with Test Automation.

Happy to out together anything you think may be useful.
